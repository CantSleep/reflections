When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Working with a team, or on several devices, of to insure work is not lost

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    if working with a group on the same branch - may not want others commits yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork - to "borrow" someone elses repository, clone - to replicate a reporitory on another machine to work on remotely, branches - write new features, bug fix ... with final goal of merge

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    just in case someone else removes a file you need in GitHub

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    keeping files in dropbox or something like that that allows collaboration.
    easier because you would not have to remember so many commands, harder would be backing out from changes

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    when developing a new feature.  Advantage master is quicker.  until your new feature is developed the branch allows you to keep new feature separate and allowing you to impliment bug fixes etc on the main branch
